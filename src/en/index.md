### Helping you understand and act on the challenges of digital transformation

With 30 years of experience in industrial IT, I now help organizations understand what digital transformation really means â€“ and how to act on it.

I founded **WELIBO**, a company that promotes a form of digital innovation that is both community-driven and locally rooted.

I'm based in Grenoble, France, and work throughout the country (and occasionally abroad).
