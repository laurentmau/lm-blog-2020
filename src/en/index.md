## **I build digital solutions with one guiding principle: to be useful, accessible, and sustainable**

As an entrepreneur, partner and CTO, I lead meaningful digital projects and help organizations better understand ongoing transformations so they can take effective action.  
My background spans 30 years in the tech industry, with roles ranging from developer and project manager to sales director, CIO, and executive committee member.

Based in Grenoble, I work across France (and sometimes beyond).

## Iâ€™m CTO and partner at **Atipik Solutions**

Most of my time is dedicated to **Watsy**, the platform developed by Atipik Solutions.  
Watsy turns shop-floor data into **practical performance levers** for industrial players.  
Itâ€™s a powerful tool designed for frontline teams, helping them make losses visible and drive improvement actions.
