## **Helping you understand and act on digital transformation**

With 30 years of experience in the IT sector, I now use my background to help organizations grasp the impact of digital technologiesâ€”and how to respond effectively.

I founded **WELIBO**, a company dedicated to promoting a digital world that brings people together and is rooted in local communities.

I'm based in Grenoble, and I work across France and occasionally abroad.
