This is the report #6 of my experimental implementation of  [Zen To Done](http://zenhabits.net/2007/11/zen-to-done-the-simple-productivity-e-book/) the productivity methodology by [Leo Babauta](http://zenhabits.net/about/).

As a reminder, the first habit I've decided to implement is to define every morning the 3 Most Important Topics (MITs) I want / need / commit to achieve during the day.

During week #1, the success rate has been[ 52 % (11/21)](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-1-results/) , during week #2, it has been [47% (9/19)](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-2-results-3-mits-per-day-43-success/), and during week #3, a total failure ([6%](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-3-results-3-mits-per-day-6-success-94-failure/)), week #4 had been better : [59% success](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-4-results-3-mits-per-day-59-success/) , week #5 has been so far the best week, with [78% succes](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-5-results-3-mits-per-day-78-success/).

[h4]Here're the results of week #6 :[/h4][list_check]
[li] **3 MITs for the week : **Did I defined 3 MITs  ? :  YES, How many did I achieve : 1/3[/li]
[li]**Day 1 (February 27th) : **Did I defined 3 MITs ? : YES, How many did I achieve :2/3[/li]
**[li]Day 2  (**February **28th) : **Did I define 3 MITs ? : YES, How many did I achieve : 2/3[/li]
**[li]Day 3 (February 29th) : **Did I define 3 MITs ? : YES, How many did I achieve : 1/3[/li]
**[li]Day 4 (March 1st) :**Did I define 3 MITs ? : YES, How many did I achieve : 0/3[/li]
**[li]Day 5 (March 2nd) : **Did I define 3 MITs ? : Yes, How many did I achieve : 1/3[/li]
**[li]Total : I’ve defined the MITs everyday, I've achieved  7/18 (39%).[/li]  **[/list_check]

[h4]What are  my conclusions ?[/h4]
[list_check]
[li]7/18  is not a very good result in term of % of success, even if last week has been very productive for me.[/li]
[li]The main explanation of the low success rate is because I had 2 actions that needed few days to be completed. I should have divided them in really achivable daily MITs. By the way, it does not really matter as I managed to finish these important actions on time.[/li]
[li]Back from Hollidays, I've successfully continued my new habbit. I can now consider that it's a win ![/li]
[li]defining MITs everyday really helped me to be (at least feel) efficient ![/li][/list_check]
**Starting this week, I'll start to implement a new routine. **
**The objective will be to come back under control with emails. I'll manage emails to stay inbox 0. **
**To achieve this, the new habbit will be to check emails daily for 30 minutes.**

Results next week ...
