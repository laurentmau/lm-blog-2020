As I've explained in a [previous post](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-lets-start/), I've decided to use [Zen To Done](http://zenhabits.net/2007/11/zen-to-done-the-simple-productivity-e-book/) productivity methodology by Leo Babauta.

This is the feedback after 1 week.

For this first week, I've decided to implement 1 new habit : 3 MITs.
The habit is simple : at the beginning of the week, and then every morning, I'll list the 3 MITs (Most Important Topics) that I want to achieve during the day (or the week).

Here are the results :

| Day            | Did I define 3 MITs? | How many achieved? |
|----------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Week           | Yes                  | 2/3                 |
| January 16th   | Yes                  | 3/3                 |
| January 17th   | Yes                  | 1/3                 |
| January 18th   | Yes (4)              | 2/4                 |
| January 19th   | Yes                  | 1/3                 |
| January 20th   | Yes                  | 2/4                 |
| **Total**      | **Yes every day**    | **11/21**           |


** What are  my conclusions ?**



  * 11/21 is a poor result. I've clearly over committed to myself during that week. There's 1 specific MIT that I've pushed from day 1 to day 5 (finally I did it in day5) that made me loose 4 points.
  * Defining the 3 MITs at the beginning of the week and every morning really helped me to focus on the good topics and to realize when I missed them.
  * During this first week, I've also drastically simplified the way I use my todo system (nirvanahq). I've removed all project, and used 1 simple list. I've also simplified the actions (remove duplicate actions, remove actions I'll never do...).  As a result, I feel really more comfortable with this system.

**For the new coming week, my objective is to continue the implementation of this new habit, with a better result !**



ps : why did I put a bonsai here ? Because I like bonsai's !
