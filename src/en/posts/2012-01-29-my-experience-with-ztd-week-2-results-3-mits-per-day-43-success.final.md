As I've explained in a [previous post](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-lets-start/), I've decided to use [Zen To Done](http://zenhabits.net/2007/11/zen-to-done-the-simple-productivity-e-book/) productivity methodology by Leo Babauta.

This is the feedback after 2 weeks.

As a reminder, the first habit I've decided to implement is to define every morning the 3 Most Important Topics (MITs) I want / need / commit to achieve during the day.

During week #1, the success rate has been[ 52 % (11/21)](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-1-results/)

Here're the results of week #2 :

Here are the results:

| Day            | Did I define 3 MITs? | How many achieved? |
|:--------------:|:--------------------:|:------------------:|
| Week           | Yes                  | 1/3                |
| January 23th   | Yes                  | 3/3                |
| January 24th   | Yes                  | 2/3                |
| January 25th   | Yes (4)              | 2/4                |
| January 26th   | Yes                  | 1/3                |
| January 27th   | No                   | 0/3                |
| **Total**      | **Defined 4 days**   | **9/19**           |


### What are my conclusions?



  * 9/19 is a poor result. It's even worse than last week (11/21). I’ve clearly over committed to myself during that week. Like last week there’s 1 specific MIT that I've pushed from day 1 to day 5  that made me loose 5  points.
  * I did not defined the MITs on friday as my work day started at 6am.
  * Even if the numbers are quite bad, I'm happy with this week. It was a VERY busy week, and defining 3 MITs everyday really helped me to keep control. I'm still happy with my new way to use todo system nirvanahq (I've removed all project, and used 1 simple list)

**For the new coming week, my objective is to continue the implementation of this new habit, with a better result !**
