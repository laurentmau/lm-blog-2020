This is the report #4 of my experimental implementation of  [Zen To Done](http://zenhabits.net/2007/11/zen-to-done-the-simple-productivity-e-book/) the productivity methodology by [Leo Babauta](http://zenhabits.net/about/).

As a reminder, the first habit I've decided to implement is to define every morning the 3 Most Important Topics (MITs) I want / need / commit to achieve during the day.

During week #1, the success rate has been[ 52 % (11/21)](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-1-results/) , during week #2, it has been [47% (9/19)](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-2-results-3-mits-per-day-43-success/), and during week #3, a total failure ([6%](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-3-results-3-mits-per-day-6-success-94-failure/))...

Here're the results of week #4 :

Here are the results:

| Day             | Did I define 3 MITs? | How many achieved? |
|:---------------:|:--------------------:|:------------------:|
| Week            | Yes                  | 1/3                |
| February 6th    | Yes                  | 3/3                |
| February 7th    | Yes                  | 1/2                |
| February 8th    | Yes                  | 2/3                |
| February 9th    | No                   | -                  |
| February 10th   | Yes                  | 3/3                |
| **Total**       | **Defined 4 days**   | **10/17 (59%)**    |


### What are my conclusions?



  * 10/17  is a better  result compare to last week and is my best result ever!
  * As decided last week, I've improved my routine, and I've defined the 3 MITs  before starting my day except on day 4.

**For the new coming week, my objective is to continue the implementation of this new habit, with a better result. If the result is there, it will be time to implement a new habbit !**
