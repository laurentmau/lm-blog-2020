This is the report #3 of my experimental implementation of  [Zen To Done](http://zenhabits.net/2007/11/zen-to-done-the-simple-productivity-e-book/) the productivity methodology by [Leo Babauta](http://zenhabits.net/about/).

As a reminder, the first habit I've decided to implement is to define every morning the 3 Most Important Topics (MITs) I want / need / commit to achieve during the day.

During week #1, the success rate has been[ 52 % (11/21)](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-1-results/) , during week #2, it has been [47% (9/19)](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-2-results-3-mits-per-day-43-success/).

Here're the results of week #3 :

Here are the results:

| Day            | Did I define 3 MITs? | How many achieved? |
|:--------------:|:--------------------:|:------------------:|
| Week           | Yes                  | 0/3                |
| January 30th   | Yes                  | 0/3                |
| January 31st   | Yes                  | 1/3                |
| February 1st   | No                   | -                  |
| February 2nd   | No                   | -                  |
| February 3rd   | No                   | -                  |
| **Total**      | **Defined 2 days**   | **1/18**           |


### What are my conclusions?



  * 1/18  is a very poor result.
  * In fact during this week I did not use ZTD. I did not take time to define 3 MITs everyday.
  * By the way, I did achieve a lot of things during this week but without planning them.
  * As a consequence, my achievements are not the most important ones, so it's not a so good result.
  * I need to improve my routine when I'm travelling to make sure I define the 3 MITs before starting my day

**For the new coming week, my objective is to continue the implementation of this new habit, with a better result (which will not be so difficult)  !**
