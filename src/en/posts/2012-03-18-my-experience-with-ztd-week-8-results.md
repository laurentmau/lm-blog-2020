This is the report #8 of my experimental implementation of  [Zen To Done](http://zenhabits.net/2007/11/zen-to-done-the-simple-productivity-e-book/) the productivity methodology by [Leo Babauta](http://zenhabits.net/about/).

As a reminder, the first habit I've decided to implement 8 weeks ago  is to define every morning the 3 Most Important Topics (MITs) I want / need / commit to achieve during the day.

The 2nd one I started to implement 2 weeks is to manage emails to stay inbox 0 and for this to spend 30 minutes per day in an "email cleaning" session.

During week #1, the success rate has been[ 52 % (11/21)](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-1-results/) , during week #2, it has been [47% (9/19)](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-2-results-3-mits-per-day-43-success/), and during week #3, a total failure ([6%](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-3-results-3-mits-per-day-6-success-94-failure/)), week #4 had been better : [59% success](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-4-results-3-mits-per-day-59-success/) , week #5 has been so far the best week, with [78% succes](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-5-results-3-mits-per-day-78-success/) , week #6 went down with a [39% success](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-6-results-3-mits-per-day-78-success/), week #7 was better with [50% success](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-7-results/).



[h4]Here're the results of week #8 :[/h4][list_check]
[li] **3 MITs for the week : **Did I defined 3 MITs  ? :  YES, How many did I achieve : 3/3[/li][li]**Day 1 (March 12th) : **Did I defined 3 MITs ? : YES, How many did I achieve :2/2. Did I clean emails : Yes[/li]**[li]Day 2  (March 13th) : **Did I define 3 MITs ? : YES, How many did I achieve : 1/2. Did I clean emails : Yes[/li]**[li]Day 3 (**March 14th**) : **Did I define 3 MITs ? : YES, How many did I achieve : 0/2. Did I clean emails : Yes[/li]**[li]Day 4 (March 15th) :**Did I define 3 MITs ? : YES, How many did I achieve : 1/2. Did I clean emails : Yes[/li]**[li]Day 5 (March 16th) : **Did I define 3 MITs ? : NO, How many did I achieve : O/2. Did I clean emails : No[/li]**[li]Total : I’ve defined the MITs 4 times instead of 5, I've achieved  11/18 (61%).[/li]  **[/list_check]

[h4]What are  my conclusions ?[/h4]
[list_check]
[li]11/18  is  a "standard" week.[/li]
[li]The new email habbit has  been very successfull.  It helped me a lot to keep under control.[/li]
[li]Defining MITs everyday really helped me to be (at least feel) efficient ![/li][/list_check]

**Next week I'll not try to implement any new routine, but I'll start again to define 3 MITs, and consider email as a fourth one.**

Results next week ...
