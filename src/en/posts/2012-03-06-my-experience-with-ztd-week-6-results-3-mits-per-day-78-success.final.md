This is the report #6 of my experimental implementation of  [Zen To Done](http://zenhabits.net/2007/11/zen-to-done-the-simple-productivity-e-book/) the productivity methodology by [Leo Babauta](http://zenhabits.net/about/).

As a reminder, the first habit I've decided to implement is to define every morning the 3 Most Important Topics (MITs) I want / need / commit to achieve during the day.

During week #1, the success rate has been[ 52 % (11/21)](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-1-results/) , during week #2, it has been [47% (9/19)](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-2-results-3-mits-per-day-43-success/), and during week #3, a total failure ([6%](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-3-results-3-mits-per-day-6-success-94-failure/)), week #4 had been better : [59% success](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-4-results-3-mits-per-day-59-success/) , week #5 has been so far the best week, with [78% succes](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-5-results-3-mits-per-day-78-success/).

### Here're the results of week #6 :

Here are the results:

| Day             | Did I define 3 MITs? | How many achieved? |
|:---------------:|:--------------------:|:------------------:|
| Week            | Yes                  | 1/3                |
| February 27th   | Yes                  | 2/3                |
| February 28th   | Yes                  | 2/3                |
| February 29th   | Yes                  | 1/3                |
| March 1st       | Yes                  | 0/3                |
| March 2nd       | Yes                  | 1/3                |
| **Total**       | **Every day**        | **7/18 (39%)**     |


### What are my conclusions?Starting this week, I'll start to implement a new routine. **
**The objective will be to come back under control with emails. I'll manage emails to stay inbox 0. **
**To achieve this, the new habbit will be to check emails daily for 30 minutes.**

Results next week ...
