This is the report #7 of my experimental implementation of  [Zen To Done](http://zenhabits.net/2007/11/zen-to-done-the-simple-productivity-e-book/) the productivity methodology by [Leo Babauta](http://zenhabits.net/about/).

As a reminder, the first habit I've decided to implement 7 weeks ago  is to define every morning the 3 Most Important Topics (MITs) I want / need / commit to achieve during the day.

The 2nd one I started to implement last week is to manage emails to stay inbox 0 and for this to spend 30 minutes per day in an "email cleaning" session.

During week #1, the success rate has been[ 52 % (11/21)](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-1-results/) , during week #2, it has been [47% (9/19)](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-2-results-3-mits-per-day-43-success/), and during week #3, a total failure ([6%](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-3-results-3-mits-per-day-6-success-94-failure/)), week #4 had been better : [59% success](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-4-results-3-mits-per-day-59-success/) , week #5 has been so far the best week, with [78% succes](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-5-results-3-mits-per-day-78-success/) , week #6 went done with a [39% success](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-6-results-3-mits-per-day-78-success/).



[h4]Here're the results of week #7 :[/h4][list_check]
[li] **3 MITs for the week : **Did I defined 3 MITs  ? :  YES, How many did I achieve : 2/3[/li]
[li]**Day 1 (March 5th) : **Did I defined 3 MITs ? : YES, How many did I achieve :0/2. Did I clean emails : Yes[/li]
**[li]Day 2  (March 6th) : **Did I define 3 MITs ? : YES, How many did I achieve : 1/2. Did I clean emails : Yes[/li]
**[li]Day 3 (**March 7th**) : **Did I define 3 MITs ? : YES, How many did I achieve : 1/2. Did I clean emails : No[/li]
**[li]Day 4 (March 8th) :**Did I define 3 MITs ? : YES, How many did I achieve : 1/2. Did I clean emails : No[/li]
**[li]Day 5 (March 9th) : **Did I define 3 MITs ? : Yes, How many did I achieve : 2/2. Did I clean emails : No[/li]
**[li]Total : I’ve defined the MITs everyday, I've achieved  9/18 (50%).[/li]  **[/list_check]

[h4]What are  my conclusions ?[/h4]
[list_check]
[li]9/18  is  a "standard" week.[/li]
[li]The new email habbit has not been so successfull yet.  I did it the first 2 days and then did not really stick to it (even if I still manage my emails !)[/li]
[li]Defining MITs everyday really helped me to be (at least feel) efficient ![/li][/list_check]

**Next week I'll not try to implement any new routine, but just have better result on the emails !**

Results next week ...
