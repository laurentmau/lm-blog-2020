As I've explained in a [previous post](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-lets-start/), I've decided to use [Zen To Done](http://zenhabits.net/2007/11/zen-to-done-the-simple-productivity-e-book/) productivity methodology by Leo Babauta.

This is the feedback after 2 weeks.

As a reminder, the first habit I've decided to implement is to define every morning the 3 Most Important Topics (MITs) I want / need / commit to achieve during the day.

During week #1, the success rate has been[ 52 % (11/21)](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-1-results/)

Here're the results of week #2 :





	  * ****3 MITs for the week : ****Did I defined 3 MITs  ? :  YES,  How many did I achieve : 1/3
	  *  **Day 1 (January 23th) : **Did I defined 3 MITs ? : YES, How many did I achieve :3/3
	  * **Day 2  (January 24th) : **Did I define 3 MITs ? : YES, How many did I achieve : 2/3
	  * **Day 3 (January 25th) : **Did I define 3 MITs ? : YES (4), How many did I achieve : 2/4
	  * **Day 4 (January 26th) :**Did I define 3 MITs ? : YES, How many did I achieve : 1/3
	  * **Day 5 (January27th) : **Did I define 3 MITs ? : NO , How many did I achieve : 0/3


	  * **Total : I’ve defined the MITs 4 times instead of 5, I've achieved  9/19.**

** What are  my conclusions ?**



	  * 9/19 is a poor result. It's even worse than last week (11/21). I’ve clearly over committed to myself during that week. Like last week there’s 1 specific MIT that I've pushed from day 1 to day 5  that made me loose 5  points.
	  * I did not defined the MITs on friday as my work day started at 6am.
	  * Even if the numbers are quite bad, I'm happy with this week. It was a VERY busy week, and defining 3 MITs everyday really helped me to keep control. I'm still happy with my new way to use todo system nirvanahq (I've removed all project, and used 1 simple list)

**For the new coming week, my objective is to continue the implementation of this new habit, with a better result !**
