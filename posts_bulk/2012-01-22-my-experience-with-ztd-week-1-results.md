As I've explained in a [previous post](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-lets-start/), I've decided to use [Zen To Done](http://zenhabits.net/2007/11/zen-to-done-the-simple-productivity-e-book/) productivity methodology by Leo Babauta.

This is the feedback after 1 week.

For this first week, I've decided to implement 1 new habit : 3 MITs.
The habit is simple : at the beginning of the week, and then every morning, I'll list the 3 MITs (Most Important Topics) that I want to achieve during the day (or the week).

Here are the sresults :



	  * ****3 MITs for the week : ****Did I defined 3 MITs  ? :  YES,  How many did I achieve : 2/3
	  *  **Day 1 (January 16th) : **Did I defined 3 MITs ? : YES, How many did I achieve : 3/3
	  * **Day 2  (January 17th) : **Did I define 3 MITs ? : YES, How many did I achieve : 1/3
	  * **Day 3 (January 18th) : **Did I define 3 MITs ? : YES (4), How many did I achieve : 2/4
	  * **Day 4 (January 19th) :**Did I define 3 MITs ? : YES, How many did I achieve : 1/3
	  * **Day 5 (January20th) : **Did I define 3 MITs ? : YES, How many did I achieve : 2/4


	  * **Total : I've defined the MITs everyday, I've achieved  11/21.**

** What are  my conclusions ?**



	  * 11/21 is a poor result. I've clearly over committed to myself during that week. There's 1 specific MIT that I've pushed from day 1 to day 5 (finally I did it in day5) that made me loose 4 points.
	  * Defining the 3 MITs at the beginning of the week and every morning really helped me to focus on the good topics and to realize when I missed them.
	  * During this first week, I've also drastically simplified the way I use my todo system (nirvanahq). I've removed all project, and used 1 simple list. I've also simplified the actions (remove duplicate actions, remove actions I'll never do...).  As a result, I feel really more comfortable with this system.

**For the new coming week, my objective is to continue the implementation of this new habit, with a better result !**



ps : why did I put a bonsai here ? Because I like bonsai's !
