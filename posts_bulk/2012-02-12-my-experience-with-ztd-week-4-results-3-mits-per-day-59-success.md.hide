This is the report #4 of my experimental implementation of  [Zen To Done](http://zenhabits.net/2007/11/zen-to-done-the-simple-productivity-e-book/) the productivity methodology by [Leo Babauta](http://zenhabits.net/about/).

As a reminder, the first habit I've decided to implement is to define every morning the 3 Most Important Topics (MITs) I want / need / commit to achieve during the day.

During week #1, the success rate has been[ 52 % (11/21)](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-1-results/) , during week #2, it has been [47% (9/19)](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-2-results-3-mits-per-day-43-success/), and during week #3, a total failure ([6%](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-3-results-3-mits-per-day-6-success-94-failure/))...

Here're the results of week #4 :





	  * ****3 MITs for the week : ****Did I defined 3 MITs  ? :  YES,  How many did I achieve : 1/3
	  *  **Day 1 (February 6th) : **Did I defined 3 MITs ? : YES, How many did I achieve :3/3
	  * **Day 2  (**February **7th) : **Did I define 3 MITs ? : YES, How many did I achieve : 1/2
	  * **Day 3 (February 8th) : **Did I define 3 MITs ? : YES, How many did I achieve : 2/3
	  * **Day 4 (February 9th) :**Did I define 3 MITs ? : NO
	  * **Day 5 (February 10th) : **Did I define 3 MITs ? : Yes, How many did I achieve : 3/3


	  * **Total : I’ve defined the MITs 4 times instead of 5, I've achieved  10/17 (59%).**

** What are  my conclusions ?**



	  * 10/17  is a better  result compare to last week and is my best result ever!
	  * As decided last week, I've improved my routine, and I've defined the 3 MITs  before starting my day except on day 4.

**For the new coming week, my objective is to continue the implementation of this new habit, with a better result. If the result is there, it will be time to implement a new habbit !**
